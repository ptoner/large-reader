              <p>Alice folded her hands, and began:—<br><br>“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,<br>    “And your hair has become very white;<br>And yet you incessantly stand on your head—<br>    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”<br><br>“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,<br>    “I feared it might injure the brain;<br>But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,<br>    Why, I do it again and again.”<br><br>“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,<br>    And have grown most uncommonly fat;<br>Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—<br>    Pray, what is the reason of that?”<br><br>“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,<br>    “I kept all my limbs very supple<br>By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—<br>    Allow me to sell you a couple?”<br><br>“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak<br>    For anything tougher than suet;<br>Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—<br>    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”<br><br>“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,<br>    And argued each case with my wife;<br>And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,<br>    Has lasted the rest of my life.”<br><br>“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose<br>    That your eye was as steady as ever;<br>Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—<br>    What made you so awfully clever?”<br><br>“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”<br>    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!<br>Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?<br>    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”<br></p>
